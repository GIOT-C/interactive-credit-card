Thank you for your interest in my project

**I needed to use html, css, javascript to write this project

#The project is written in TypeScript, a React component

#this project is a credit card form. The form has validation logic for various fields such as card number, CVC, expiration date, and cardholder name. Additionally, there's a conditional rendering based on whether the form has been submitted or not.

Your users should be able to:
- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
-  Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  -  Any input field is empty
  -  The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
-View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
-See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

##Expected behaviour:
- Update the details on the card as the user fills in the fields
- Validate the form fields when the form is submitted
- If there are no errors, display the completed state
